### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
 - My main programming languages are C/C++, but I'm excited to learn more!
 - I have some exprerience in 
 -  - such languages as Dart, C# (and small amount in PHP, Javascript, Haskell)
 -  - such frameworks as Qt, Flutter (small amount in Unity and Godot) 
 -  - Git, Linux, networking, 3D graphics, algorithms - and I'm ready to improve myself in this and other fields. 
 - I'm looking for work on operating systems or game engines, but also want to try myself in other fields.
